# Basic-Portfolio

2 things that I could not figure out during my homework, no matter how much reviewing and revising
is how I managed to tamper with the opacity of the footer (without ever coding anything for opacity) and 
how to fix the portfolio container. 
 
 I'm assuming it has something to do with the portfolio.html because it isn't an issue with the "about" and 
 "contact" pages. I ran out of time trying to fix it, but I'll continue working on the problem another time.
